## What is a report?

The report on laboratory work is written based on the results of the assignment, in which the student receives practical skills and finds application for his theoretical knowledge. In its structure, the report does not differ much from other types of scientific papers.
## How to format a report?

The content of the report to our laboratory work on operating systems:
one). Title page indicating the number of laboratory work and the name of the student.
2). Formulation of the purpose of the work.
3). Description of the results of the task:
- screenshots (screenshots) that record the performance of laboratory work;
– listings (source code) of programs (if any);
– results of program execution (text or screenshot, depending on the task).
four). Conclusions consistent with the purpose of the work.
5). Answers to control questions.
