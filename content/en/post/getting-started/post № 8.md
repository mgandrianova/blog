## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formal language for writing computer programs. A programming language defines a set of lexical, syntactic and semantic rules that determine the appearance of the program and the actions that the performer (usually a computer) will perform under its control.

Since the creation of the first programmable machines, mankind has come up with more than eight thousand programming languages ​​(including esoteric, visual and toy ones). Every year their number increases. Some languages ​​are used only by a small number of their own developers, others become known to millions of people. Professional programmers can be proficient in several programming languages.

A programming language is intended for writing computer programs, which are a set of rules that allow a computer to perform a particular computational process, organize control of various objects, etc. A programming language differs from natural languages ​​in that it is designed to control a computer, while how natural languages ​​are used primarily for communication between people. Most programming languages ​​use special constructs to define and manipulate data structures and control the process of computation.

## Scientific programming languages

Scientific programming is a highly oriented style of programming for scientific computing. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, and the predominance of efficiency over universality.
Scientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies - from quantum computers to space programs - would not be possible without scientific programmers who can provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.

Scientists use various programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of problem and the preferences of the author. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran; many debugged libraries of mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations are written on it, which is relevant for economics and biology, respectively.

Python has a simpler syntax, which is also suitable for programming mathematical calculations. The Python language is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and can work with some other "scientific" languages: Fortran, C++, C#.

In turn, C# allows you to program on the .NET platform, adapt the program to the common language runtime (CLR), and accelerate development within the framework of operational scientific sessions.
