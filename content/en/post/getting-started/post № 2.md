## What is version control?

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to program code. Version control systems are software tools that help development teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments become more complex, they help development teams work faster and more efficiently. Version control systems are most useful for DevOps teams because they help reduce development time and increase the number of successful deployments.

Version control software keeps track of all changes made to the code in a special database. When a bug is found, developers can go back and compare to earlier versions of the code to fix bugs, minimizing problems for everyone on the team.
