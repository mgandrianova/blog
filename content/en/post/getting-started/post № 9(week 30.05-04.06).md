## Last week

This week I went to face-to-face classes of mathematical logic, mathematical analysis. In my free time, I did labs #13 and #14 on operating systems. On Monday, May 30, I took an oral exam in English, which I passed with 14/20 marks. All day on May 31, I was preparing for the test in mathematical logic, thanks to which I got the first maximum of 30/30 points. On June 1, I was also preparing for a test, but already in mathematical analysis, I watched a lot of videos on multiple and curvilinear integrals on YouTube, the scores are not yet known. On Friday I gave a lecture on mathematical analysis, got 5/5 points, I'm glad. Today is Saturday, I completed the last laboratory work (№ 13 and № 14), now I am doing the 6th stage of an individual project.
