## What is Markdown language?

Markdown (pronounced markdown) is a lightweight markup language designed to indicate formatting in plain text while maintaining human readability as much as possible, and suitable for machine conversion into advanced publishing languages ​​(HTML, Rich Text, and others).

## Story

Originally created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz. Many language ideas have been borrowed from existing text markup conventions in emails. Markdown language implementations convert Markdown text to valid, well-formed XHTML and replace left angle brackets ("<") and ampersands ("&") with the appropriate entity codes. The first implementation of Markdown was Gruber's Perl implementation, but after a while, many third-party implementations appeared. The Perl implementation is distributed under a BSD type license. Implementations of Markdown in various programming languages ​​are included (or available as a plugin) in many content management systems.
